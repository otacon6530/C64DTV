## Mod Log
### 10/4/2021 -Replaced batteries with 5v 1amp DC adapter.
The batteries together created 5.8v, which was too high for the keyboard mod I wanted to do, so the batteries were replaced with a $2 5v 1 amp DC adapter from my local used thrift store. The mode was pretty easy, since it only involved desodering the wires connected to the battery compartment and connecting them to the DC adapter (I cut off the end). This is a proof concept to validate the adapter would work. I intend to install micro usb to the case and power adapter in order to upgrade the device and allow for mid to high end usb phone adapters to power the device going forward.
